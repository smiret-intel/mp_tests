Compute elasticity matrix for an arbitrary crystal structure defined by a
periodic cell and basis atom positions. Note that this can also be applied to
representative volume elements (RVEs) of non-crystlline materials with the RVE
taken to be periodic.

The code also computes the distance from the obtained elasticity tensor to
the nearest isotropic tensor using. This provides a measure of the anisotropy
of the crystal. Note that this calculation can fail if the elasticity tensor
is not positive definite.

The following methods for computing the elastic constants are supported:

(I) energy-condensed : Compute elastic constants from the hessian of the
condensed strain energy density, W_eff(eps) = min_d W(eps,d), where d are
the displacements of the internal atoms (aside from preventing rigid-body
translation) and eps is the strain.

(II) stress-condensed : Compute elastic constants from the jacobian of the
condensed stress, sig_eff(eps) = sig(eps,dmin), where dmin = arg min_d
W(eps,d). A faster, less accurate version of this approach
(stress-condensed-fast), is also provided.

(III) energy-full : Compute elastic constants from the hessian of the full
strain energy density, W(eps,d). This involves an algebraic manipulation
to account for the effect of atom relaxation; see eqn (27), in Tadmor et
al, Phys. Rev. B, 59:235-245, 1999.

All three methods give similar results with differences beyond the first or
second digit due to the numerical differentiation. The `energy-condensed` and
`energy-full` approaches have comparable accuracy, but full Hessian is *much*
slower. The `stress-condensed` approach is significantly faster than
`energy-condensed`, but is less accurate. The default apporach is
`energy-condensed`. The other methods are retained in the code for testing
purposes or, for very large systems, the `stress-condensed` method is an
option.

=== Theory ===

All three approaches involves numerical differentiation of energy or stress
expressions in terms of strains represented in Voigt notation. This is requires
the introduction of factors to account for the Voigt form as explained below.

The code assumes a Voigt notation with the following ordering:
1 = 11,  2 = 22,  3 = 33,  4 = 23,  5 = 13,  6 = 12  ---------------(1)

In this notation, the linear elastic stress-strain relation for infinitesimal
defomation is give by:

sig_m = C_mn eps_n -------------------------------------------------(2)

where

sig_1 = sig_11,  sig_2 = sig_22,  sig_3 = sig_33
sig_4 = sig_23,  sig_5 = sig_13,  sig_6 = sig_12

eps_1 = eps_11,  eps_2 = eps_22,  eps_3 = eps_33
eps_4 = gam_23,  eps_5 = gam_13,  eps_6 = gam_12 -------------------(3)

and gam_ij = 2 eps_ij.

In the above sig_ij and eps_ij are the components of the stress and strain
tensors in a Cartesian basis. The same basis is used to define the orientation
of the periodic cell and basis atom positions.

=== Energy-based calculation of elastic constants ===

The strain energy density of a linear elastic meterial is

W = 1/2 c_ijkl eps_ij eps_kl ---------------------------------------(4)

where c_ijkl are the components of the 4th-order elasticity tensor.
In Voigt notation strain energy density has the form:

W = 1/2 C_mn eps_m eps_n -------------------------------------------(5)

where C_mn are the components of elasticity matrix. The symmetries in the
summation of Eqn (4) (which includes 81 terms) are captured by the factors
of two in the 4, 5, 6 components of eps_* in Eqn (3).

Eqn (4) implies that the elasticity tensor components are given by

c_ijkl = d^2 W / d eps_ij d eps_kl ---------------------------------(6)

Substituting into Eqn (6), the definition of W in Eqn (5), a chain rule
must be applied:

c_ijkl = (d^2 W / d eps_m d eps_n )(d eps_m / d eps_ij)(d eps_n / d eps_kl)

                                                                    (7)

Transforming to Voigt notation and accounting for the factors of two
in the shear terms in Eqn (3), we have

C_mn = d^2 W / d eps_m d eps_n               for m,n <=3

C_mn = (1/2) d^2 W / d eps_m d eps_n         for m<=3, n>3  or
                                                 m>3, n<=3

C_mn = (1/4) d^2 W / d eps_m d eps_n         for m,n > 3

=== Stress-based calculation of elastic constants ===

An alternative aproach to computing the elastic constants is to use the
stress-strain relation in Eqn (2), which in full tensorial notation is

sig_ij = c_ijkl eps_kl ---------------------------------------------(8)

This relation implies that

c_ijkl = d sig_ij / d eps_kl ---------------------------------------(9)

Substituting in Eqn (2) for the stress and applying the chain rule,

c_ijkl = (d sig_m / d eps_n)(d eps_n / d eps_kl) ------------------(10)

where m is the Voigt index for ij. Transforming to Voigt notation and
accounting for the factors of two in the shear terms in Eqn (3), we have

C_mn = d sig_m / d eps_n                     for m,n <=3

C_mn = (1/2) d sig_m / d eps_n               for n > 3

    Use PreconLBFGS to Minimize cell energy with respect to cell shape and
    internal atom positions.

    PreconLBGS convergence behavior is as follows:
    - The solver returns True if it is able to converge within the optimizer
      iteration limits (which can be changed by the `steps` argument passed
      to `run`), otherwise it returns False.
    - The solver raises an exception in situations where the line search cannot
      improve the solution, typically due to an incompatibility between the
      potential's values for energy, forces, and/or stress.

    This routine attempts to minimizes the energy until the force and stress
    reduce below specified tolerances given a provided limit on the number of
    allowed steps. The code returns when convergence is achieved or no
    further progress can be made, either due to reaching the iteration step
    limit, or a stalled minimization due to line search failures.

                Select method for computing the elastic constants. The following
                methods are supported:
                'energy-condensed' : Compute elastic constants from the Hessian
                    of the condensed strain energy density (i.e. the enregy for
                    a given strain is relaxed with respect to internal atom
                    positions)
                'stress-condensed' : Compute elastic constants from the Jacobian
                    of the condensed stress (i.e. the stress for a given strain
                    where the energy is relaxed with respect to internal atom
                    positions)
                'stress-condensed-fast' : Same as 'stress-condensed' but
                    the numerical differentiation is performed with a single
                    step size (instead of a more accurate Richardson
                    extraploation). Useful for large systems where the cost of
                    the more accurate method is prohibitive.
                'energy-full' : Compute elastic constants from the full Hessian
                    relative to both strains and internal atom degrees of
                    freedom. This is followed by an algebraic manipulation to
                    account for the effect of atom relaxation on elastic
                    constants.
                In general, 'energy-condensed' is the preferred method.
                The 'stress-condensed' method is much faster, but generally less
                accurate. The 'energy-full' method has accuracy comparable
                to 'energy-condensed' but tends to be much slower due to the
                larger Hessian matrix that has to be computed.

                constants returned by numdifftools. Same units as
