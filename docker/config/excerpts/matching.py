    Some SMs require some sort of special simulation setup to occur on the part
    of the Test or Verification Check, e.g. those that correspond to bonded
    potentials require that the bonding topology be explicitly defined by the
    Test or VC. Accordingly, Tests and VCs are now required to contain a key
    called "matching-models" in their kimspec file. This field is always
    array-valued and can either contain ["standard-models"] or a list of
    strings that define an SM subclass, e.g. ["iff/cvff", "iff/pcff"].
    The logic for this type of matching is as follows:

    (a) If the value of "matching-models" of the runner is the array
        ["standard-models"], the runner will match with all PMs as well as
        any SM that lists the value "portable-models" in the
        "run-compatibility" key of their kimspec (note that the
        "run-compatibility" key is required for all MOs and SMs).

    (b) If the value of "matching-models" of the runner is not
        ["standard-models"] but rather a list of special-purpose SM strings,
        then the runner will not run against PMs. Instead, it will match
        against any SM whose 'simulator-potential' kimspec value is contained
        in the "matching-models" array of the runner in the sense of a
        slash-delimited hierarchical scheme which is implemented in the
        simulator_potential_hierarchy_match function below.

    and is summarized in the following table:

    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |           Test/VC         |     |                                          |
    |  matching-models list "A" | PM  |                 SM                       |
    |===========================|=====|==========================================|
    |  A=["standard-models"]    | yes |  run-compatibility == "portable-models"  |
    |  A=[...]                  |  no |  simulator-potential in A                |
